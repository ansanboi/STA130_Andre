    "From this particular experience, I found that Copilot did an almost-perfect job of solving my queries and errors concerning the code. I think that, provided with proper context, a chatbot such as Copilot and ChatGPT can solve most coding problems. My personal philosophy is to double check with a Google search every now and again to ensure the chatbot is not hallucinating. This way, you can draw a parallel between what the chatbot tells you to do and how other experienced programmers and engineers across the internet would tackle the same problem. I would place a strong emphasis on providing proper context and wording. I would also note that it is important to establish the realm in which you are discussing things: instructing the chatbot to answer you in a specific context, such as data analysis and coding."
